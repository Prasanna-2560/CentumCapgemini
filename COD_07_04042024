//2.Chef and Instant NoodlesChef has invented 1 .1-minute Instant Noodles. As the name suggests, each packet takes exactly 1.1 minute to cook.Chef's restaurant has X stoves and only 1.
1 packet can be cooked in a single stove at any minute.How many customers can Chef serve in Y minutes if each customer orders exactly 1.1 packet of noodles?
Input Format:The first and only line of input contains two space-separated integers X and Y — the number of stoves and the number of minutes, respectively.
Output Format:Print a single integer, the maximum number of customers Chef can serve in Y minutes
Constraints:1≤ , ≤1000
1≤X,Y≤1000//

//3.Currently there are courses for 4 languages, and hence there are 8 courses in this section. But suppose there are courses for N languages, what will be the total number of courses in this section?
Input Format:The only line of input will contain a single integer N, denoting the number of languages for which there are courses.
Output Format:Output on a single line the total number of courses in the section.//

//4 Chef and Brain Speed
In ChefLand, human brain speed is measured in bits per second (bps). Chef has a threshold limit of X bits per second above which his calculations are prone to errors. If Chef is currently working at Y bits per second, is he prone to errors?If Chef is prone to errors print YES, otherwise print NO.
Input Format:The only line of input contains two space separated integers X and Y — the threshold limit and the rate at which Chef is currently working at.
Output Format:If Chef is prone to errors print YES, otherwise print NO.
You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings yes, Yes, yEs, and YES will all be treated as identical).//
